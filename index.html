                    Gary Steven Goseland, father, grandfather, and friend, passed away peacefully on August 21, 2025, at the age of 73. 
                    Steve, as he was known to family and friends, was born on December 30, 1951, at St. Joseph Hospital in Wichita, Kansas, 
                    to Marilyn and Jack Goseland.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Steve grew up in Wichita and graduated from Wichita North High School. He continued his education at Fort Hays State 
                    University, where he was a proud member of the TKE fraternity. Throughout his career, Steve worked in various fields 
                    including pharmaceutical sales with Calhoun, retail management at Calhoun department store and Target, real estate, 
                    and Office Depot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On July 28, 1974, Steve married Michelle Sherraden, and together they welcomed two children, Jefferson and Randi, into their 
                    family. Though their marriage ended in divorce on February 14, 1994. He married again on September 8th 1998, to 
                    Vivian (Vickie) Eldridge.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Steve's life journey took him to many places across the country, including Great Bend, KS, McPherson, KS, Wichita, KS, Matthan, KS, 
                    Pineville, NC; Sarasota, Cape Coral, and Port Charlotte, FL. His warm smile and kind heart made him a friend to all wherever 
                    he lived, and his wisdom and guidance were cherished by his family and community.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Steve was a goofball with a gentle spirit who found joy in life's simple pleasures. He loved western movies and oldies 
                    music, especially the Everly Brothers, and was a devoted fan of The Three Stooges, often setting his alarm early to watch 
                    their shows. His love for Star Wars and classic entertainment reflected his appreciation for fishwives tales and humor.
                </p>

                <p class="closing">
                    Steve was preceded in death by his parents, Marilyn Dole and Jack Goseland, step brothers Alan and Brent, step sister Wilda, 
                    niece Jackie and nephew Adam and stepfather Jack Dole. Though Steve has left this earthly life, his spirit lives on in the hearts of all who knew 
                    him. May he rest in peace, surrounded by the eternal love of God.
